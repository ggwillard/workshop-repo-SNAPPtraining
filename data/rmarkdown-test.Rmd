# Header One

Here is some explanation about my work. **Bold text here**

A bulleted list needs to have a blank line above it to be treated as a list in Markdown

* apple 
* pear
* avocado

here is another paragraph

$\sum{x^2}$

```{r name_1}
# hash here denotes a comment
x <- c(1, 20, -7)
x
```

here is a hidden chunk, we're not showing the code used to generate this result of y

```{r, echo = FALSE}
y <- x + 4
y
```

```{r}
bg_chem <-read.csv(file = "data/BGchem2008data.csv")
```
